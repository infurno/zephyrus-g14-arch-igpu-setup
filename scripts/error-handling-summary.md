sudo dnf install package-name

# After
install_package_with_recovery "package-name" 3  # 3 retries
```

### 2. Enhanced Service Management
```bash
# Before
sudo systemctl start service-name

# After
manage_service_with_recovery "service-name" "start" 2  # 2 retries
```

### 3. Enhanced Configuration Installation
```bash
# Before
sudo cp config.conf /etc/config.conf

# After
install_config_with_backup "config.conf" "/etc/config.conf" "Configuration description"
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Exit
```bash
# Before
echo "Error occurred" && exit 1

# After
enhanced_error_exit "Error occurred" "$E_CONFIG_ERROR" "recovery_function_name" "Additional context"
```
