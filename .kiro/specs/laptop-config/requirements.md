# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive laptop configuration repository for the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (GA403WR) with hybrid GPU setup (AMD Radeon 890M iGPU + NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU). The repository will provide automated setup scripts, configuration files, and documentation to optimize the laptop for battery life on the iGPU while maintaining the ability to use the NVIDIA dGPU for gaming and CUDA workloads when needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a laptop user, I want an automated setup script for Arch Linux that configures my hybrid GPU system optimally, so that I can have maximum battery life on the iGPU while retaining access to the NVIDIA GPU for performance tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup script is executed THEN the system SHALL install all necessary drivers and packages for hybrid GPU operation
2. WHEN the setup script completes THEN the system SHALL be configured to use the AMD iGPU as primary display driver
3. WHEN the setup script finishes THEN the system SHALL have NVIDIA GPU available for offload rendering via prime-run commands
4. WHEN the system boots THEN the internal display SHALL work correctly without black screen issues
5. IF the system is running on battery THEN the NVIDIA GPU SHALL be automatically powered down to save battery

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper power management configuration, so that my laptop achieves optimal battery life during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL use amd-pstate-epp for CPU frequency scaling if supported
2. WHEN power management is active THEN the system SHALL use auto-cpufreq and TLP for automatic power optimization
3. WHEN on battery power THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to power-saving profiles
4. WHEN the laptop is idle THEN unnecessary hardware components SHALL be powered down automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gamer and ML enthusiast, I want seamless GPU switching capabilities, so that I can use the NVIDIA GPU for gaming and CUDA workloads when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a command with prime-run THEN the application SHALL execute using the NVIDIA GPU
2. WHEN I need CUDA functionality THEN the NVIDIA drivers SHALL support CUDA operations
3. WHEN using external displays THEN the system SHALL properly route display output through the appropriate GPU
4. WHEN switching between iGPU and dGPU modes THEN the transition SHALL be seamless without system instability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of ASUS hardware, I want ASUS-specific tools and optimizations, so that I can take full advantage of my laptop's features and hardware controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL include asusctl for hardware control
2. WHEN ASUS tools are installed THEN supergfxctl SHALL be available for GPU management
3. WHEN using the system THEN rog-control-center SHALL provide a GUI for hardware settings
4. WHEN power profiles are needed THEN power-profiles-daemon SHALL provide different performance modes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation and modular configuration files, so that users can easily understand, customize, and troubleshoot the setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the repository THEN it SHALL contain clear installation and usage instructions
2. WHEN configuration is needed THEN separate config files SHALL be provided for different components
3. WHEN troubleshooting is required THEN the documentation SHALL include common issues and solutions
4. WHEN customization is desired THEN the setup SHALL be modular and easily configurable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want the setup to handle Xorg configuration properly, so that my hybrid GPU setup works reliably with the display server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Xorg is configured THEN it SHALL use AMD GPU as primary display driver
2. WHEN external displays are connected THEN they SHALL work correctly through both GPUs
3. WHEN applications need GPU acceleration THEN the proper GPU SHALL be selected based on the use case
4. WHEN the system starts THEN Xorg SHALL initialize without conflicts between GPU drivers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated system maintenance and optimization, so that the laptop configuration remains optimal over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated THEN kernel modules SHALL be rebuilt automatically if needed
2. WHEN new drivers are available THEN the system SHALL handle updates gracefully
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN initramfs and bootloader SHALL be updated appropriately
4. WHEN system services are installed THEN they SHALL be properly enabled and configured to start automatically
